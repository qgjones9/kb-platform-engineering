# Configuration file for MkDocs
# Introduction:
# https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#introduction
# https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/
#
# Project settings are configured by default using a YAML configuration file in
# the project directory named mkdocs.yml. You can specify another path
# for it by using the -f/--config-file option (see mkdocs build --help).
#

# description: This is a required setting, and should be a string that
#   is used as the main title of the project documentation. When
#   rendering the theme this setting will be passed as the site_name

#
# default: required
#   At a minimum, this configuration file must contain the site_name.
#   All other settings are optional.

# description: Set the canonical URL of the site. This will add a link
#   tag with the canonical URL to the head section of each HTML page.
#   If the 'root' of the MkDocs site will be within a subdirectory of a
#   domain, be sure to
#   include that subdirectory in the setting (https://example.com/foo/).
#   This setting is also used for mkdocs serve: the server will be mounted onto
#   a path taken from the path component of the URL, e.g. some/page.md
#   will be served from http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo/some/page/ to mimic the
#   expected remote layout.

# repo_name: see https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#repo_name
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# repo_name: ""
#
# description: When set, provides a link to your repository (GitHub, GitLab) on
#   each page.
#
# default: 'GitHub', 'Bitbucket' or 'GitLab' if the repo_url matches those
#   domains, otherwise the hostname from the repo_url.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# edit_uri: see https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#edit_uri
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# edit_uri: ""
#
#
# description: The path from the base repo_url to the docs directory when
#   directly viewing a page, accounting for specifics of the repository host
#   (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket, etc), the branch, and the docs directory itself.
#   MkDocs concatenates repo_url and edit_uri, and appends the input path
#   of the page.
#
#   When set, and if your theme supports it, provides a link directly
#   to the page in your source repository. This makes it easier to find
#   and edit the source for the page. If repo_url is not set, this
#   option is ignored. On some themes, setting this option may cause an
#   edit link to be used in place
#   of a repository link. Other themes may show both links.
#
#   The edit_uri supports query ('?') and fragment ('#') characters.
#   For repository hosts that use a query or a fragment to access the files,
#   the edit_uri might be set as follows. (Note the ? and # in the URI...)
#
#   Query string example:
#   edit_uri: '?query=root/path/docs/'
#
#   Hash fragment example:
#   edit_uri: '#fragment=root/path/docs/'
#
#   For other repository hosts, simply specify the relative path to the docs
#   directory for example.
#   edit_uri: root/path/docs/
#
#   For example, having this config:
#   repo_url: https://example.com/project/repo
#   edit_uri: blob/main/docs/
#   means that a page named 'foo/bar.md' will have its edit link lead to:
#   https://example.com/project/repo/blob/main/docs/foo/bar.md
#
#   edit_uri can actually be just an absolute URL, not necessarily relative to
#   repo_url, so this can achieve the same result:
#   edit_uri: https://example.com/project/repo/blob/main/docs/
#
#   For more flexibility, see edit_uri_template below.
#   https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#edit_uri_template
#
# default: edit/master/docs/ for GitHub and GitLab repos or src/default/docs/
#   for a Bitbucket repo, if repo_url matches those domains, otherwise null

#
# description:
#  The more flexible variant of edit_uri. These two are equivalent:
#   edit_uri: 'blob/main/docs/'
#   edit_uri_template: 'blob/main/docs/{path}'
#
#   (they are also mutually exclusive -- don't specify both).
#   Starting from here, you can change the positioning or formatting of the
#   path, in case the default behavior of appending the path isn't enough.
#
#   The contents of edit_uri_template are normal Python format strings,
#   with only
#   these fields available:
#   {path}, e.g. foo/bar.md
#   {path_noext}, e.g. foo/bar
#
#   And the conversion flag !q is available, to percent-encode the field:
#   {path!q}, e.g. foo%2Fbar.md

# nav: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#nav
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# description:
#   This setting is used to determine the format and layout of the global
#   navigation for the site. A minimal navigation configuration could look like
#   this:
#
#   nav:
#     - index.md
#     - about.md
#     - contact.md
#
#   All paths in the navigation configuration must be relative to the docs_dir
#   configuration option.
#   see: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#docs_dir
#
#   See the section on configuring pages and navigation for a more detailed
#   breakdown, including how to create sub-sections.
#   https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/
#   #configure-pages-and-navigation
#
#   Navigation items may also include links to external sites. While titles are
#   optional for internal links, they are required for external links. An
#   external link may be a full URL or a relative URL. Any path which is not
#   found in the files is assumed to be an external link. See the section about
#   Meta-Data on how MkDocs determines the page title of a document.
#
#   see: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#meta-data
#
#  nav:
#    - Introduction: 'index.md'
#    - 'about.md'
#    - 'Issue Tracker': 'https://example.com/'
#
#  In the above example, the first two items point to local files while the
#  third points to an external site.
#
#  However, sometimes the MkDocs site is hosted in a subdirectory of a project's
#  site and you may want to link to other parts of the same site without
#  including the full domain. In that case, you may use an appropriate relative
#  URL.
#
#  site_url: https://example.com/foo/
#
#  nav:
#    - Home: '../'
#    - 'User Guide': 'user-guide.md'
#    - 'Bug Tracker': '/bugs/'
#
#  In the above example, two different styles of external links are used.
#  First, note that the site_url indicates the MkDocs site is hosted in the
#  /foo/ subdirectory of the domain. Therefore, the Home navigation item is a
#  relative link that moves up one level to the server root and effectively
#  points to https://example.com/. The Bug Tracker item uses an absolute path
#  from the server root and points to https://example.com/bugs/. Of course, the
#  User Guide points to a local MkDocs page.
#
# default: By default nav will contain an alphanumerically sorted, nested list
#   of all the Markdown files found within the docs_dir and its sub-directories.
#   Index files will always be listed first within a sub-section.

#  exclude_docs: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#exclude_docs
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   verions 1.5+
#
#   Changed in version 1.6:
#   This config no longer applies the "drafts" functionality for mkdocs serve.
#   If you have draft documents that you want available in "serve" and
#   not "build",
#   replace exclude_docs with the new draft_docs config option.
#
#   This config defines patterns of files (under docs_dir) to not be picked up
#   into the built site.
#
#     exclude_docs: |
#       api-config.json    # A file with this name anywhere.
#       /requirements.txt  # Top-level "docs/requirements.txt".
#       *.py               # Any file with this extension anywhere.
#       !/foo/example.py   # But keep this particular file.
#
#   This follows the .gitignore pattern format.
#   see: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format
#   The following defaults are always implicitly prepended - to exclude
#   dot-files (and directories) as well as the top-level templates directory:
#
#     exclude_docs: |
#       .*
#       /templates/
#
#   So, in order to really start this config fresh, you'd need to specify a
#   negated version of these entries first.
#   Otherwise you could for example opt only certain dot-files back into the
#   site:
#     exclude_docs: |
#       !.assets  # Don't exclude '.assets' although all other '.*' are excluded
#
#   default: null
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# draft_docs: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#draft_docs
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   verions 1.6+
#
# Description:
#   This config defines patterns of files (under docs_dir) to be treated as a
#   draft. Draft files are available during mkdocs serve and include a "DRAFT"
#   mark but will not be included in the build. To prevent this effect and make
#   "serve" behave the same as "build", you can run mkdocs serve --clean.
#
#  Example:
#
#    draft_docs: |
#      drafts/               # A "drafts" directory anywhere.
#      _unpublished.md       # A md file ending in _unpublished.md
#      !/foo_unpublished.md  # But keep this particular file.
#
#   default: null
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# not_in_nav: see https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#not_in_nav
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   verions 1.5+
#
#   Changed in version 1.6:
#      the nav config is not specified at all, pages specified in this config
#      will now be excluded from the inferred navigation.
#
#   If you want to include some docs into the site but intentionally exclude
#   them from the nav, normally MkDocs warns about this.
#
#   Adding such patterns of files (relative to docs_dir) into the not_in_nav
#   config will prevent such warnings.
#
#   Example:
#
#   nav:
#     - Foo: foo.md
#     - Bar: bar.md
#
#   not_in_nav: |
#     /private.md
#
#   As the previous option, this follows the .gitignore pattern format.
#
#   default: null

# Full list of values and examples of log messages that they can hide or

#
#   validation.nav.omitted_files
#     The following pages exist in the docs directory, but are not
#     included in the "nav" configuration: ...
#
#   validation.nav.not_found
#     A reference to 'foo/bar.md' is included in the 'nav' configuration,
#     which is not found in the documentation files.
#
#     A reference to 'foo/bar.md' is included in the 'nav' configuration,
#     but this file is excluded from the built site.
#
#   validation.nav.absolute_links
#     An absolute path to '/foo/bar.html' is included in the 'nav'
#     configuration, which presumably points to an external resource.
#
#   validation.links.not_found
#     Doc file 'example.md' contains a link '../foo/bar.md', but the
#     target is not found among documentation files.
#
#     Doc file 'example.md' contains a link to 'foo/bar.md' which is
#     excluded from the built site.
#
#   validation.links.anchors
#     Doc file 'example.md' contains a link '../foo/bar.md#some-heading',
#     but the doc 'foo/bar.md' does not contain an anchor '#some-heading'.
#
#     Doc file 'example.md' contains a link '#some-heading', but there is
#     no such anchor on this page.
#
#   validation.links.absolute_links
#     Doc file 'example.md' contains an absolute link '/foo/bar.html',
#     it was left as is. Did you mean 'foo/bar.md'?
#
#   validation.links.unrecognized_links
#     Doc file 'example.md' contains an unrecognized relative link
#     '../foo/bar/', it was left as is. Did you mean 'foo/bar.md'?
#    Doc file 'example.md' contains an unrecognized relative link
#    'mail@example.com', it was left as is. Did you mean
#    'mailto:mail@example.com'?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# validate abosolue links
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Historically, within Markdown, MkDocs only recognized relative links that
# lead to another physical *.md document (or media file). This is a good
# convention to follow because then the source pages are also freely browsable
# without MkDocs, for example on GitHub. Whereas absolute links were left
# unmodified (making them often not work as expected) or, more recently,
# warned against. If you dislike having to always use relative links, now you
# can opt into absolute links and have them work correctly.

# If you set the setting validation.links.absolute_links to the new value
# relative_to_docs, all Markdown links starting with / will be understood as
# being relative to the docs_dir root. The links will then be validated for
# correctness according to all the other rules that were already working for
# relative links in prior versions of MkDocs. For the HTML output, these links
# will still be turned relative so that the site still works reliably.

# So, now any document (e.g. "dir1/foo.md") can link to the document
# "dir2/bar.md" as [link](/dir2/bar.md), in addition to the previously only
# correct way [link](../dir2/bar.md).
#
# You have to enable the setting, though. The default is still to just skip the link.
#

#      absolute_links: relative_to_docs

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# site_dir: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#site_dir
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The directory containing the documentation source markdown files. This can

# directory containing your configuration file, or it can be an absolute
# directory path from the root of your local file system.
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# site_dir: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/#site_dir
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The directory where the output HTML and other files are created. This can
# either be a relative directory, in which case it is resolved relative to the
# directory containing your configuration file, or it can be an absolute
# directory path from the root of your local file system.
#
# default: "site"
#
# Note
# If you are using source code control you will normally want to ensure that
# your build output files are not committed into the repository, and only keep
# the source files under version control. For example, if using git you might
# add the following line to your .gitignore file:
#
# site/
#
# If you're using another source code control tool, you'll want to check its
# documentation on how to ignore specific directories.
