# [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/docs/introduction/)


Kyverno (Greek for “govern”) is a cloud native policy engine. It was originally built for Kubernetes and now can also be used outside of Kubernetes clusters as a unified policy language.

Kyverno allows platform engineers to automate security, compliance, and best practices validation and deliver secure self-service to application teams.
